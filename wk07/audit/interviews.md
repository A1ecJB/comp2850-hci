# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: [2025-11-18 14:28]
**Context**: Prefers using dark mode on applications. COmfortable using either a trackpad/mouse or a keyboard for navigation. No underlying health conditions. Near sighted.
**Consent**: Verbal consent given for interview
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "The last time I used one was probably last week when i used the reminder app on my phone or organise and list the module assignments I had that week. When I wrote the assignments into the reminder app, I forogt to write the time for one of them, so I had to go back and check when it was due which took extra time. I also tapped one of them and it got removed by accident."

**Observations**:
- 
- Time pressure context (deadline stress)
- Tag-based workflow (not just chronological)

**Themes**: `filter_persistence`, `cognitive_load`, `deadline_anxiety`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "When I accidentally erased one of my assignments about the list. There was no confirmation when about to delete an entry from the list and it seems top easy to delete something by accident."

**Observations**:
- Lack of confirmation feedback
- Low trust in interface
- Workaround = page reload (inefficient)

**Themes**: `status_feedback`, `confirmation`, `trust`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "Recently, I accidentally deleted that task, which caused me to forget when that assignment was due and I was almost late in submitting it."

**Observations**:
- List length issue (visibility)
- Prioritisation need
- Consequence = missed deadline (high impact)

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `visibility`, `urgent_tasks`

### Q4: How have you found work without a mouse?
**Response**: "typically i can operate a computer without a mouse but i will struggle quite a lot with browser navigation when only using a keyboard. i have in the past used keyboard navigation, so i would be moderately comfortable"

**Observations**:
- Keyboard-only experience = friction
- Temporary impairment (broken hardware)
- Exclusion from features

**Themes**: `keyboard_nav`, `temporary_impairment`, `button_accessibility`

### Q5: How do you found it with eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "with eyes closed, i would be very stuck in trying to navigate and id probably struggle to manage. in bright sunlight, i would fare a bit better. the real issue would be in the dark because of my eyesight"

**Observations**:
- Contrast issue (situational disability)
- Zoom breaks responsive design
- Environmental factor (sunlight)

**Themes**: `contrast`, `zoom`, `responsive_design`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "progress visualisation would be nice i.e. you could see how many tasks you'd completed and how many are outstanding for that week or overall."

**Observations**:
- Motivation through feedback
- Progress visualisation
- Weekly scope (not just daily)

**Themes**: `progress_tracking`, `motivation`, `feedback`

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Filter resets → cognitive overload
2. No confirmation feedback → uncertainty
3. Keyboard navigation gaps → temporary exclusion
4. Contrast issues in bright light → situational disability

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm filtering tasks, I want the selection to persist across page reloads so I don't lose my place."
- "When I submit a form, I want immediate confirmation so I know it worked without refreshing."
- "When my mouse breaks, I want full keyboard access so I can still complete tasks."
