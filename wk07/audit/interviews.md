# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: [2025-11-18 14:28]
**Context**: Prefers using dark mode on applications. Comfortable using either a trackpad/mouse or a keyboard for navigation. No underlying health conditions. Near-sighted.
**Consent**: Verbal consent given for interview
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: When did you last use task management software?
**Response**: "The last time I used one was probably last week when i used the reminder app on my phone or organise and list the module assignments I had that week. When I wrote the assignments into the reminder app, I forgot to write the time for one of them, so I had to go back and check when it was due which took extra time. I also tapped one of them and it got removed by accident."

**Observations**:
- Required additional information about tasks (due dates)
- Features being accidentally invoked
- Not prompted to remember to fill in certain fields

**Themes**: `additional_information`, `accidental_features`, `missing_fields`

---

### Q2: What frustrated you about the software?
**Response**: "When I accidentally erased one of my assignments about the list. There was no confirmation when about to delete an entry from the list and it seems top easy to delete something by accident."

**Observations**:
- Lack of confirmation on actions
- Lack of confidence in interface
- Requires need for confirmation or undo action

**Themes**: `safe_data_handling`, `confirmation`, `confidence_in_software's_design`

---

### Q3: Did you ever lose track of an important task?
**Response**: "Recently, I accidentally deleted that task, which caused me to forget when that assignment was due and I was almost late in submitting it."

**Observations**:
- Real life consequences of poor software design
- Need for deleted task recovery
- Potential requirement for early reminders (in case of tasks neglected)

**Themes**: `reminders`, `recovery`, `real_life_consequence`

---

### Q4: How have you found work without a mouse?
**Response**: "typically I can operate a computer without a mouse but I will struggle quite a lot with browser navigation when only using a keyboard. I have in the past used keyboard navigation, so I would be moderately comfortable"

**Observations**:
- Poor ease of use for basic actions
- Requires experience to use efficiently (inaccessible to those who have not used computers often if at all)
- Navigation is more difficult

**Themes**: `navigation`, `experience_requirement`, `ease_of_use`

---

### Q5: How do you found it with eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "With eyes closed, I would be very stuck in trying to navigate, and I'd probably struggle to manage. in bright sunlight, I would fare a bit better. The real issue would be in the dark because of my eyesight"

**Observations**:
- Fully reliant on eyesight for all functionality
- Minor issue with bright light sources
- Lack of suitable lighting causes issues for visually impaired

**Themes**: `visually_reliant`, `lighting_requirement`, `environmental_obstructions`

---

### Q6: What is one feature you would like to see added?
**Response**: "progress visualisation would be nice i.e. you could see how many tasks you'd completed and how many are outstanding for that week or overall."

**Observations**:
- Visual tracking for clarity
- Task filtering
- Group by time frame

**Themes**: `visal_representation`, `filtering`, `time_frame`

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Lost data / no reminders → forgetting important information
2. No action confirmation → accidents
3. Keyboard only → difficult to use efficiently without experience
4. Issues in too little/too intense light → Exploits issues with visual reliance

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm reading tasks, I want the ability for screen reading, so I can check details while unable to see the screen."
- "When I perform an action, I want a confirmation requirement, so I know it can avoid mistakes."
- "When my mouse breaks, I want my keyboard to quickly be able to access all parts of an interface, so I can still use its functionality."
